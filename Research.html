<b>Project:</b> Your Face Tells Everything: An Analysis of Human Emotions with Internet and without Internet</p>

<p class="auto-style2"> <b>Objective:</b> To analyze the user emotion, we have conducted 
semi-structured interviews and to find the reasons and we concentrated on all 
age groups and users like the internet and SNSs. We are hoping that this 
study will be helpful to our future work in facial recognition.</p>

<p class="auto-style2"> <b>Outcome:</b> In this study, we analyzed the user behavior, 
usage of emoticons, depression while browsing the internet through descriptive 
statistics. In this study, most of the participants are feeling stressed while 
browsing the internet or using SNSs in. They may not feel stress 
in the regularly but they feel stress at some point of time. </p>

<b>Project:</b> The role of machine learning concepts in biometric recognition of face and iris </p>

<p class="auto-style2"> <b>Objective:</b> The main goal of machine learning concept is to reach 
a state when machines are able to respond without humans explicitly programming them. 
Machine learning concepts are efficiently used for feature extraction and 
classification and also directly applicable to biometric systems.This 
paper purely concentrating on feature extraction and classification. </p>

<p class="auto-style2"> <b>Outcome:</b> In this paper we tried to discuss briefly 
about the most important topics, trends, challenges from the area of biometric 
face and iris recognition, in this paper we focused on feature extraction and 
classification of data with the help of machine learning concepts. </p>
