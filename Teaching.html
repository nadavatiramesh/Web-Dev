<p class="auto-style2"> I worked as a teaching assistant at the University of Michigan, Flint. 
I have taught courses like C, Python, Java, MySQL, SQL, Oracle, HTML, XML, PHP, JavaScript, 
MatLab to my junior students as a tutor. I met people from different cultures and 
I had so much fun and learn a lot about cultures. Teaching job is a wonderfull experience it helps me to be updated on technologies everyday.
